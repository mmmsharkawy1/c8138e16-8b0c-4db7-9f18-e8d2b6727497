# Implementation Plan: Multi-tenant SaaS for Wholesalers

Building a robust, scalable SaaS platform for wholesalers including a Storefront, POS, Merchant Dashboard, and Super Admin Panel.

## Proposed Architecture

### Multi-tenancy Strategy
- **Shared Database, Isolated Schemas (or `tenant_id` filtering)**: We will use a `tenant_id` column for most tables to ensure data isolation.
- **Routing**: Subdomain-based (e.g., `merchant1.saas.com`) or path-based (e.g., `saas.com/merchant1`).

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ (App Router) for SEO-friendly storefronts and fast dashboards.
- **UI Components**: Shadcn UI + Lucide Icons for a premium feel.
- **Database/Auth**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) for rapid multi-tenant development, Auth, and Real-time POS updates.
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS / Tailwind (if needed for speed).

## Proposed Components

### 1. Super Admin Dashboard [Owner]
- Manage merchants (onboarding, suspension).
- Monitor system-wide analytics.
- Subscription management.

### 2. Merchant Dashboard [Wholesaler]
- Inventory management.
- Order management.
- Sales reports.
- Store setup (logo, theme).

### 3. POS (Point of Sale)
- Barcode scanning integration.
- Quick product selection.
- Receipt generation.
- Offline support (Service Workers).

### 4. Merchant Storefront
- Product catalog.
- Shopping cart.
- Customer accounts.

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- Multi-tenancy isolation tests (Ensure Merchant A cannot see Merchant B's data).
- Auth flow validation.

### Manual Verification
- Testing the POS flow with simulated hardware.
- UI responsiveness on mobile devices.
